My project is about Student Record System. It is a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage and maintain student information in a structured format. Built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, the system allows users to perform essential operations such as adding, viewing, searching, and deleting student records. This project aims to simplify the process of student data management by offering a menu-driven interface that is user-friendly and functional within a terminal environment. File handling is used to store data persistently, ensuring records are saved even after the program is closed. The project not only improves data organization but also reduces the chances of manual errors. By developing this system, I gained hands-on experience with OOP concepts, data validation, user interaction through the console, and file management in Python. It serves as a foundational tool that can be extended to more advanced applications, such as GUI-based systems or database-integrated solutions in the future.
